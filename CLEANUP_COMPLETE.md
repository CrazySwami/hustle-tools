# Code Editing Tool Cleanup - Complete

## ✅ Successfully Removed: `editCodeWithDiff` Tool

The old diff-based code editing tool has been completely removed from the codebase.

### Files Modified:

1. **`/src/lib/tools.ts`**
   - ❌ Removed `editCodeWithDiffTool` definition
   - ❌ Removed from tools export object
   - ✅ Kept only `editCodeWithMorphTool` (Morph Fast Apply)

2. **`/src/app/api/chat-elementor/route.ts`**
   - ❌ Removed `editCodeWithDiff` from tools config
   - ❌ Removed references from system prompt
   - ✅ Updated instructions to show only Morph and Direct Replacement options

### Current Code Editing Architecture:

**Option 1: Morph Fast Apply (PREFERRED - 98% accurate, 10x faster)**
- Tool: `editCodeWithMorph`
- Uses lazy edits with `// ... existing code ...` markers
- No approval workflow needed
- Works with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP files
- Applies changes immediately

**Option 2: Direct Replacement (for complete rewrites only)**
- Tools: `updateSectionHtml`, `updateSectionCss`, `updateSectionJs`, `updateSectionPhp`
- Replaces entire file content
- Best for major restructuring

### Benefits of Morph-Only Approach:

1. **Simpler UX** - No diff approval dialogs
2. **Faster** - 10x faster than generating diffs
3. **More Accurate** - 98% success rate
4. **Better DX** - AI doesn't need to generate complex diff format
5. **Unified** - One tool for all targeted edits

### Usage Tracking Status:

✅ **FULLY WORKING**
- Server sends metadata via `messageMetadata` callback
- Client receives via `useEffect` watcher on messages array
- Displays in Usage tab with correct costs
- All models priced correctly

## Next: Element Inspector Integration

The GrapeJS Visual Editor element selection needs to be updated to use Morph instead of the old diff tool.

**Error to Fix:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getComponent')
```

This error occurs in the Visual Editor when selecting elements. The element inspector should:
1. Extract selected element HTML/CSS
2. Prompt user for edit instruction
3. Call `editCodeWithMorph` tool
4. Apply changes using Morph Fast Apply

### Files to Update:
- Element inspector component (needs Morph integration)
- Visual Editor selection handler (remove diff references)
