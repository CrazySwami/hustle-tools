## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes to First Run)

### Option 1: Follow the Master Guide (Recommended)

**Open:** `MASTER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide walks you through **every single step** with:
- ✅ Exact commands to run
- ✅ Configuration file templates
- ✅ Troubleshooting for common issues
- ✅ Feature parity checklist
- ✅ Deployment instructions

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours total

---

### Option 2: Ultra-Fast Reference Setup (30 Minutes)

**If you just want the code accessible in your Next.js project:**

```bash
# 1. Copy this entire MIGRATION_PACKAGE folder to your Next.js project
cp -r MIGRATION_PACKAGE /path/to/your-nextjs-project/reference

# 2. In your Next.js code, reference the original modules
# Example: components/ChatInterface.tsx
import { ChatUI } from '../reference/SOURCE_CODE/modules/chat-ui';

# 3. Use MASTER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md as you build
```

This lets you **use all the original working code** while building your Next.js version.

## 🎯 Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Hybrid Approach (Recommended - 2 Hours)

**Best for:** Most developers

**How it works:**
1. Copy original modules to Next.js `lib/` folder (no changes!)
2. Create React component wrappers around them
3. Use existing CSS with Tailwind additions
4. Convert state management to React hooks

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fastest path to working app
- ✅ 80% of code works unchanged
- ✅ Can gradually modernize later

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Mix of vanilla JS and React

**Time:** ~2 hours

---

### Strategy 2: Copy Reference and Build Gradually (Ongoing)

**Best for:** Long-term projects, want to learn gradually

**How it works:**
1. Copy this entire package to your Next.js project
2. Build new Next.js features referencing original code
3. Migrate one feature at a time over weeks

**Pros:**
- ✅ Always have working reference
- ✅ No pressure to migrate everything at once
- ✅ Learn as you go

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Two codebases to maintain initially

**Time:** Flexible (weeks/months)

---

### Strategy 3: Full Rewrite (Not Recommended)

**Best for:** Expert Next.js developers, need full control

**How it works:**
1. Read all documentation
2. Rewrite everything in TypeScript + React
3. Convert all CSS to Tailwind

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully modern codebase
- ✅ Type safety everywhere
- ✅ No legacy patterns

**Cons:**
- ❌ Takes 10-15 hours
- ❌ High risk of bugs
- ❌ Must deeply understand original code

**Time:** ~15 hours

**Our Recommendation:** Don't do this. Use Strategy 1 instead.

### Must-Read Files

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `MASTER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Complete step-by-step migration | Before starting |
| `REFERENCE_DOCS/FILE_STRUCTURE_MAP.md` | Every file explained | During migration |
| `REFERENCE_DOCS/COMPLETE_FEATURES_GUIDE.md` | Feature deep dive | When stuck or curious |
| `REFERENCE_DOCS/TOOL_UI_DISPLAYS.md` | AI tool UI patterns | When working on tools |

### Reference-Only Files

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `REFERENCE_DOCS/CLAUDE.md` | Quick reference | Occasional lookup |
| `SOURCE_CODE/*` | Original implementation | When you need to see how something works |

## 🔧 What's Included in Templates

### Configuration Files (Ready to Use)

- ✅ `package.json` - All dependencies
- ✅ `next.config.js` - Webpack & API configuration
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript settings
- ✅ `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind + custom animations
- ✅ `.env.local.example` - Environment variables template

### Source Code (Copy These)

**80% of code can be copied without changes!**

- ✅ `modules/openai-client.js` → `lib/` (works as-is)

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Can't find module '@/lib/...'"

**Fix:**
```json
// tsconfig.json - Check this exists
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### "OpenAI API key not found"

**Fix:**
```bash
# .env.local must use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### "window is not defined"

**Fix:**
```tsx
// Add 'use client' to any component using browser APIs
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

### Build Fails

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```
