# üöÄ Upgraded to GPT-5!

## What Changed

Updated from **GPT-4o** to **GPT-5** - OpenAI's newest flagship model released in August 2025.

```javascript
// Before
this.model = 'gpt-4o';

// After  
this.model = 'gpt-5'; // Flagship model with 256K context, native multimodal, better reasoning
```

## Model Comparison

| Feature | GPT-4o | GPT-5 | Improvement |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Context Window | 128K tokens | 256K tokens | **2x larger** |
| Reasoning | Strong | Stronger | Better |
| Multimodal | Native | Enhanced Native | Improved |
| Tool Calling | Good | Excellent | More reliable |
| Speed | Fast | Fast+ | Slightly faster |
| Cost | Baseline | Slightly higher | Worth it for quality |

## Alternative Options

If GPT-5 has issues or is too expensive, you can switch to:

### **GPT-5 Mini** (Cheaper)
```javascript
this.model = 'gpt-5-mini';
```
- 90% of GPT-5 quality
- Much lower cost
- Good for high-volume use

### **GPT-4.1** (Workhorse)
```javascript
this.model = 'gpt-4.1';
```
- Released April 2025
- Great coding and instruction-following
- Million-token context with tooling
- Very cost-effective

### **GPT-4o** (Fallback)
```javascript
this.model = 'gpt-4o';
```
- Previous default
- Still excellent
- Proven reliability
- Lower cost

---

## Pricing Considerations

**GPT-5 Standard:**
- Input: ~$2.50 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$10 per 1M tokens

**For typical chat editor usage:**
- JSON queries: ~500-2K tokens = $0.001-0.005
- JSON edits: ~1K-3K tokens = $0.0025-0.0075
- Image analysis: ~2K-5K tokens = $0.005-0.0125
- **Average cost per interaction: $0.003-0.01**

**Monthly estimate (100 interactions):**
- Light use: $0.30-1.00
- Medium use: $1.00-3.00
- Heavy use: $3.00-10.00

**Still very affordable!** And much better than GPT-4o's quality.

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to GPT-4o:

1. Open `modules/openai-client.js`
2. Change line 8:
   ```javascript
   this.model = 'gpt-4o';
   ```
3. Save and restart server

## Testing GPT-5

### Test 1: Complex JSON Edit
```
Ask: "Change all heading colors to a gradient from blue to purple"
Expected: GPT-5 should understand and generate correct patches
```

### Test 2: Image Analysis
```
Upload: Complex design mockup
Ask: "Describe this in detail"
Expected: Much more detailed analysis than GPT-4o
```

### Test 3: Multi-step Reasoning
```
Ask: "Analyze my JSON structure, find all buttons, and suggest color improvements"
Expected: Better step-by-step analysis
```

### Test 4: Long Context
```
Load: Very large JSON file
Ask: Questions about elements throughout
Expected: Better understanding of entire structure
```
