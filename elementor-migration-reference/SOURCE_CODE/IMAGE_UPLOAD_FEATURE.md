## Example Conversations

### With Image Upload:
```
You: [uploads mockup image]
     "Can you create a JSON structure similar to this design?"

AI: I can see a modern landing page with a hero section, feature cards,
    and a CTA button. I'll generate JSON to match this layout...
```

### With Screenshot:
```
You: [screenshots playground]
     "The heading looks too small, what size is it?"

AI: Looking at the screenshot, I can see the heading "Welcome to My Site".
    According to the JSON, it's set to 32px. Would you like me to increase it?
```

### Design Analysis:
```
You: [uploads reference image]
     "Match the color scheme from this image"

AI: I can see a blue and orange color palette. The primary blue appears
    to be around #2563eb and the accent orange is #f97316. I'll update
    your JSON to use these colors...
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **`chat-editor.html`**
   - Added image upload button + hidden file input
   - Added image preview area with remove button
   - Added context menu for image options
   - New methods: `handleImageUpload()`, `screenshotPlayground()`, `displayImage()`, `removeImage()`
   - Updated `handleSendMessage()` to include images

2. **`modules/chat-ui.js`**
   - Updated `renderMessage()` to display images in chat
   - Images shown as `<img>` tags with proper styling

3. **`modules/openai-client.js`**
   - Updated `sendMessage()` to accept `imageBase64` parameter
   - Builds multimodal message format for GPT-4 Vision
   - Uses `image_url` content type with `detail: 'high'`

4. **`styles/chat-editor-styles.css`**
   - New styles for `.image-button`
   - Image preview area styling
   - Context menu styles
   - Message image display styles

### Image Format

Images are sent to OpenAI as base64-encoded data URLs:
```javascript
{
    type: 'image_url',
    image_url: {
        url: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...',
        detail: 'high'
    }
}
```

### Screenshot Implementation

Currently uses Canvas API to create a placeholder screenshot (white background with text). This can be enhanced with:
- `html2canvas` library for real iframe capture
- WordPress Playground API screenshot methods
- Server-side screenshot tools

## Limitations

### Current Screenshot Method
- Shows placeholder text instead of actual iframe content
- Due to CORS restrictions on cross-origin iframes
- Can be improved with proper screenshot libraries

### Image Restrictions
- Max 5MB per image
- Only visual formats (no PDFs, videos, etc.)
- One image per message (removed after sending)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Multiple images** per message
2. **Real iframe screenshots** using html2canvas or Playground API
3. **Image history** - keep uploaded images in conversation
4. **Image editing** - crop, resize before sending
5. **Drag & drop** upload support
6. **Paste from clipboard**
7. **OCR text extraction** from images

## Security & Privacy

- ‚úÖ Images processed client-side
- ‚úÖ Base64 encoding in browser
- ‚úÖ File type validation
- ‚úÖ Size validation (5MB limit)
- ‚úÖ Images only sent to OpenAI API
- ‚úÖ No server-side storage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI processes images according to their privacy policy

## Cost Considerations

**OpenAI Vision API Pricing** (as of 2024):
- **High detail** (our setting): ~$0.01-0.02 per image
- Depends on image resolution
- Counted as additional tokens

**Recommendation**: Use images when necessary for design feedback, not for every message.
