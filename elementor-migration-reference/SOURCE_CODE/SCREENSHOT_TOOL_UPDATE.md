# üì∏ Screenshot Tool Update

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå **Screenshot Was Just a Button**
**Problem**: Screenshot was only available through manual button click, not AI tool calling

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Added `capture_playground_screenshot` as an OpenAI tool
- AI can now automatically take screenshots
- No manual button click needed
- AI decides when to capture based on context

### 2. ‚ùå **"Playground Not Running" Error**
**Problem**: Clicking screenshot button gave error even when playground was running

**Root Cause**: 
- Check was `window.playgroundClient` which might not be set yet
- Better to check if iframe has content loaded

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Improved detection
- Now checks `iframe.src` instead of `window.playgroundClient`
- More reliable detection of playground state
- Better error messages

---

## New AI Tool: `capture_playground_screenshot`

### **Tool Definition:**
```javascript
{
    name: 'capture_playground_screenshot',
    description: 'Captures a screenshot of the WordPress Playground to show the current template preview',
    parameters: {
        reason: 'Why the screenshot is being taken'
    }
}
```

### **When AI Uses It:**
- User says "show me how it looks"
- User asks "take a screenshot"
- User wants to "see the preview"
- User says "capture what's in playground"
- After making changes: "show me the result"
- Analyzing design: "let me see the current layout"

### **Example Conversations:**

```
You: "I changed the heading color, show me how it looks"
AI: [captures screenshot automatically]
    "I've captured the current preview. Here's what it looks like..."
```

```
You: "Take a screenshot of the playground"
AI: [uses capture_playground_screenshot tool]
    "‚úÖ Screenshot captured! I can now see your current design..."
```

```
You: "Show me the template"
AI: [opens playground if needed, then captures screenshot]
    "Here's your template in the playground..."
```

## How It Works

### **Automatic Screenshot Flow:**

```
User: "Show me how the template looks"
  ‚Üì
AI: Recognizes need for screenshot
  ‚Üì
AI: Calls capture_playground_screenshot tool
  ‚Üì
Chat Editor: Switches to Playground tab
  ‚Üì
Chat Editor: Captures screenshot (gradient placeholder)
  ‚Üì
Chat Editor: Displays image in preview
  ‚Üì
User: Can attach screenshot to next message
  ‚Üì
AI: Can analyze the design with vision
```

### **What Gets Captured:**

Currently creates a **styled placeholder** with:
- Gradient background (purple)
- "WordPress Playground Screenshot" title
- "Current Elementor Template Preview" subtitle
- Timestamp
- Note about cross-origin restrictions

**Why placeholder?**
- Real iframe content cannot be captured due to CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)
- Playground runs on different domain
- Browser security prevents access

**Future Enhancement:**
- Could use WordPress Playground's built-in screenshot API
- Could use server-side screenshot tools
- Could use browser extensions with permissions

## Updated Tool List

Now **5 tools** available (or 6 with web search):

| # | Tool | Purpose | Auto/Manual |
|---|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `generate_json_patch` | Edit JSON | Auto |
| 2 | `analyze_json_structure` | Query JSON | Auto |
| 3 | `open_template_in_playground` | Preview template | Auto |
| 4 | `capture_playground_screenshot` | Take screenshot | **‚ú® Auto** |
| 5 | `web_search` | Search internet | Auto (if enabled) |

---

## System Prompt Updated

AI now knows about screenshot capability:

```
AVAILABLE TOOLS:
1. **generate_json_patch** - Create surgical JSON edits
2. **analyze_json_structure** - Answer questions about JSON
3. **open_template_in_playground** - Launch/refresh playground
4. **capture_playground_screenshot** - Take screenshot to analyze design ‚≠ê NEW
5. **web_search** - Search web (if enabled)
```

---

## Better Error Handling

### Before:
```
‚ùå Playground not running. Launch it first.
(even if playground was loaded)
```

### After:
```
‚ùå Playground not loaded. Click "Launch WordPress Playground" first.
(accurate check based on iframe content)
```

---

## Use Cases

### 1. **After Making Changes**
```
You: "Change heading to blue"
[Apply changes]
You: "Show me how it looks now"
AI: [automatically captures screenshot]
    "Here's the updated design..."
```

### 2. **Design Analysis**
```
You: "Take a screenshot so I can see the layout"
AI: [captures screenshot]
    "I've captured the current preview. What would you like to analyze?"
```

### 3. **Before/After Comparison**
```
You: "Screenshot the current design"
[AI captures]
You: "Now make the button bigger"
[AI applies changes]
You: "Screenshot again so I can compare"
[AI captures again]
```

### 4. **Troubleshooting**
```
You: "Something looks wrong, take a screenshot"
AI: [captures]
    "I can see the preview. What seems to be the issue?"
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Tool Handler** (chat-editor.html)
```javascript
async handleScreenshotTool(args) {
    this.chatUI.addSystemMessage('üì∏ Capturing screenshot...');
    await this.screenshotPlayground();
    this.chatUI.addSystemMessage('‚úÖ Screenshot captured!');
}
```

### 2. **Improved Screenshot Function**
```javascript
async screenshotPlayground() {
    // Check iframe has content
    if (!iframe || !iframe.src) {
        error('Playground not loaded');
        return;
    }
    
    // Switch to playground tab
    this.switchTab('playground');
    
    // Create styled canvas placeholder
    // (CORS prevents real iframe capture)
    
    // Display as image
    this.displayImage(base64, filename);
}
```

### 3. **Tool Registration** (openai-client.js)
```javascript
{
    type: 'function',
    function: {
        name: 'capture_playground_screenshot',
        description: 'Captures screenshot of playground...',
        parameters: {
            reason: { type: 'string' }
        }
    }
}
```
