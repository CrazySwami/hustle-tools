Generate conversational "bridge content" that:
1. Confirms the task is running in the background RIGHT NOW
2. Explains what's happening at a high level (2-3 sentences)
3. Sets expectations for what they'll get when it's done
4. Feels natural and human, like you're keeping them company

Tone: Friendly, conversational, enthusiastic but not over-the-top

Examples:
- "Write a story with HTML" ‚Üí "Perfect! I've started working on that story with the HTML page in the background. While that's processing, I'm crafting a narrative and structuring the code so it looks great in a browser. You'll have a complete story with clean HTML when this finishes."

- "Analyze this data report" ‚Üí "Got it! The analysis is running now in the background. I'm digging through the data points, looking for patterns and key insights. In a moment, I'll have a summary of the main findings for you."

Generate 40-60 words of natural speech. DO NOT use phrases like "Let me tell you" or "Here's what's happening" - just speak naturally.`;
